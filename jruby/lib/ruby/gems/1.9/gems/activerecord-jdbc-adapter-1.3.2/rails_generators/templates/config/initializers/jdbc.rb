# This file was generated by the "jdbc" generator, which is provided by the

#
# This file allows the JDBC adapters to be hooked into ActiveRecord such that 
# you don't have to change anything else in your Rails application.
# 
# NOTE: This is only needed on Rails 2.x - without Bundler since when you're
# using Bundler than `gem 'activerecord-jdbc-adapter'` will automatically 
# `require 'arjdbc'` by default (unless you set it to `require: false`).
